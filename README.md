# Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) problems. I have implemented them in Rust because it's my favorite language.

# Usage

## Nix

If you have `direnv` installed, simply:
1. `git clone https://github.com/gamersekofy/aoc-2024-rs/ && cd aoc-2024-rs`
2. `direnv allow`
3. Profit!

If you don't have `direnv` installed, simply:

1. `git clone https://github.com/gamersekofy/aoc-2024-rs/ && cd aoc-2024-rs`
2. `nix develop`
3. Profit!
